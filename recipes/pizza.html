        Description
    </h3>
    <p>
        Mix a simple yeast-leavened dough until smooth, let it rise until doubled, then stretch it into a round or rectangle. Spread with tangy tomato sauce, scatter shredded mozzarella and your favorite toppings in an even layer. Bake on a preheated stone or baking sheet at high heat until the crust is crisp and golden, then finish with fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil.
